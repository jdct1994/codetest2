What is the difference between a service and a factory?
Both factories and services allow us to create an object that can then be used anywhere in our app.
Factories are functions that return the object, while services are constructor functions of the object which are instantiated with the 'new' keyword.
Function allows us to add some logic before creating the object we require. It differs from Service in a way where it allows us to pass the function which factory then invokes and returns the result. Service provider function creates a service object by using 'new' keyword and you can add properties to it by using this keyword, then it returns this.
